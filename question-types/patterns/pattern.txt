so patterns are always implemented with nested for loops.
- the outer loop is gonna represent the rows/lines
- the inner loop is gonna show the number of coloumns, and try to link the coloumns to the number of rows somehow.
- optional : try to find symmetry
- alwasy print whatever is to be printed, inside the for loop only.

example 1 : rectangular star pattern

N = 4
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *

here, the there are 4 rows and each row has 4 stars.

example 2 : right angled triangle

N = 4
*
* *
* * *
* * * *

here, the lower right angle triangle is visualized, each row has that many stars, 1st row -> 1 star, 2nd row -> 2 stars, etc..
