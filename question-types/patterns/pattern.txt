so patterns are always implemented with nested for loops.
- the outer loop is gonna represent the rows/lines
- the inner loop is gonna show the number of coloumns, and try to link the coloumns to the number of rows somehow.
- optional : try to find symmetry
- alwasy print whatever is to be printed, inside the for loop only.

example 1 : rectangular star pattern

N = 4
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *

here, the there are 4 rows and each row has 4 stars.

example 2 : right angled triangle

N = 4
*
* *
* * *
* * * *

here, the lower right angle triangle is visualized, each row has that many stars, 1st row -> 1 star, 2nd row -> 2 stars, etc..

example 3 : right angle numbered pyramid

N = 3
1
1 2
1 2 3

lower triangle of the pattern filled with integers starting from 1.

example 4 : right angle numbered pyramid - II

N = 3
1
2 2
3 3 3

here, the inner loop is gonna print the values n times for each n row, but the value is the n row value. 1st row -> 1 number with value 1, 2nd row -> 2 numbers, with value 2
print i here.

example 5 : invereted right angle triangle

N = 3
* * *
* *
*

here, the inner loop should be decreasing, i=0, we have n stars, i=1 we have n-1.. so on
